<h3>Version 1.0</h3>

<p></p>

"Go Silent" helps you to toggle settings of phone on scheduled event time. So that, you don't have to worry about putting phone silent while going to meeting.
<br><br>
In this version, you can Schedule an event and set toggles to Ringer & Notifications, Media Setting, Alarm Setting,
Wi-Fi Setting, Bluetooth Setting and Mobile Data Setting. 
<br><br>At this point, we only allow user to set toggle during event and change it back to previous settings after event finished.
